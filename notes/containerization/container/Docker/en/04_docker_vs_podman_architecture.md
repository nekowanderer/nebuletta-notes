# Docker vs. Podman Architecture Comparison

[English](../en/04_docker_vs_podman_architecture.md) | [繁體中文](../zh-tw/04_docker_vs_podman_architecture.md) | [日本語](../ja/04_docker_vs_podman_architecture.md) | [Back to Index](../README.md)

## Docker Architecture and Security Risks

Docker adopts a Client-Server architecture where the Docker Daemon is the core component:

- **Docker Client**: Receives user commands
- **Docker Daemon**:
  - Runs with **ROOT privileges**
  - Manages images and containers
  - Represents a **Single Point of Failure** in the system
  - Poses **security risks** (UNSAFE)

### Docker Architecture Diagram

```
User → Docker Client → Docker Daemon (ROOT privileges)
                          ↓
                     [images] [containers]
```

## Podman Architecture Advantages

Podman (Pod Manager) adopts a daemonless architecture:

- **Podman Client**: Directly manages containers
- **No Daemon Required**:
  - No background service process needed
  - Each container runs with user privileges
  - No single point of failure issue
  - More secure privilege management

### Podman Architecture Diagram

```
User → Podman Client
          ↓

```

## Key Differences Comparison

| Feature | Docker | Podman |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Architecture | Client-Daemon | Daemonless |
| Privilege Requirements | Requires ROOT | User privileges |
| Security | Lower (privileged execution) | Higher (unprivileged) |
| Single Point of Failure | Exists (Daemon) | Does not exist |
| Resource Consumption | Higher (persistent Daemon) | Lower (on-demand startup) |
| Underlying Runtime | containerd | runc (closer to OCI-compliant runtime) |

## Security Impact

### Docker Security Concerns
- Docker Daemon runs with root privileges; if compromised, it could affect the entire system
- All containers share the same Daemon, increasing the attack surface
- Daemon failure affects all running containers

### Podman Security Advantages
- Each container runs with user privileges, reducing privilege escalation risks
- No persistent privileged processes
- Containers are relatively independent, reducing lateral attack risks

## Practical Considerations

While Podman has clear security advantages, selection should still consider:

- **Compatibility**: Docker ecosystem is more mature
- **Learning Curve**: Podman commands are highly similar to Docker
- **Enterprise Support**: Docker has more comprehensive commercial support
- **Tool Integration**: Many CI/CD tools primarily support Docker

## Conclusion

Podman's daemonless architecture offers clear advantages in security and system stability, particularly suitable for:
- Environments with high security requirements
- Multi-user systems
- Scenarios requiring avoidance of single points of failure

Meanwhile, Docker continues to lead in ease of use and ecosystem completeness.
